# AUTOMATIC1111 Stable Diffusion WebUI 1.5 + ChilloutMix + Kohya's Scripts

[[Web UI] Go To Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/wibus-wee/stable_diffusion_chilloutmix_ipynb/blob/main/stable_diffusion_1_5_webui.ipynb) | [[LoRA Train] Go To Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/wibus-wee/stable_diffusion_chilloutmix_ipynb/blob/main/lora_train.ipynb) | [[Xformers Build] Go To Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/wibus-wee/stable_diffusion_chilloutmix_ipynb/blob/main/xformers_build.ipynb) | [Prompts Collection](/prompts.md)

Now the download script of ["Recommended Loras"](#recommended-loras) and ["Recommended Checkpoints"](#recommended-checkpoints) has been built into the script (before startup), if you don't want to download it, you can disable them before startup.

Most of the models are the latest versions from [CivitAI](https://civitai.com), but some LoRA models are marked with special versions, which are versions that I personally think are better. If you don't want to use this version, you may need to download other versions yourself (see below).

If you want to download other models, you can go to the CivitAI tab in WebUI to download it yourself (if you have checked the install Civitai Browser extension option). In addition, remember to check the Save to Additional Network option.

The script has already soft-linked the LoRA in Additional Network to the `models/Lora` folder, but when using WebUI to download LoRA, you need to manually soft-link it to the `models/Stable-diffusion` folder, or restart the program to refresh the soft link.

> **Warning**: Please note that there may be legal risks before painting. Please note whether your painting may cause controversy and negative impact on the development of the AI community. Please use it with caution.


## Roadmap

- [x] Paperspace Support
- [x] Support for training LoRA Jupyter Notebook
- [x] Optimize model download speed with aria2
- [x] Internationalization
- [x] Provide xformer support for Paperspace M4000 GPU
- [x] Soft link LoRA in Additional Network to `models/Stable-diffusion` folder

Jupyter Notebook's Language is still Chinese, I want to find a way to make it internationalized, but maintaining two versions is a bit troublesome, so I will do it later.

## About Training LoRA

Basic training script based on [Akegarasu/lora-scripts](https://github.com/Akegarasu/lora-scripts) which is based on [kohya-ss/sd-scripts](https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-scripts), but you can also use [ddPn08/kohya-sd-scripts-webui](https://github.com/ddPn08/kohya-sd-scripts-webui) which provides a GUI, it is more convenient, I also provide the corresponding SD WebUI extension installation method in `stable_diffusion_1_5_webui.ipynb`.

Some models are not compatible with the training script, and the training script will not be able to train them. If you want to train them, you need to use the training script provided by the model author.

> In [kohya-ss/sd-scripts train_network documentaion](https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-scripts/blob/main/train_network_README-ja.md), it notes that the cloneofsimo's repository and the d8ahazard's Dreambooth Extension for Stable-Diffusion-WebUI are not compatible at the current time. This is because they have extended some features.

## Recommended Loras

> It seems that the LoRA related to **@kbr** has disappeared, and I don't know the reason. Currently, you can find it at https://github.com/wibus-wee/stable_diffusion_chilloutmix_ipynb/releases/tag/koreanDollLikeness, I have uploaded it to the release.
>
> In addition, I have updated the startup script so that if you check install `koreanDollLikeness`, it will be installed automatically.

## Experimental LoRA

Experimental LoRA refers to models that are not yet fully tested by me, and have not yet been determined to be compatible. If you want to use these models, please judge the compatibility with other LoRA by yourself.

## Build xformers from source

If you are using Google Colab, there are many precompiled wheels for you to choose from. If you are using something else or want to build from source, you can use this notebook to build the library.

I have written a [notebook](./xformers_build.ipynb) to build xformers from source. You can use it to build xformers for your own GPU.
