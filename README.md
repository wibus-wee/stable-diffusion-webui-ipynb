# AUTOMATIC1111 Stable Diffusion WebUI 1.5 + ChilloutMix Checkpoint

[Go To Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/wibus-wee/stable_diffusion_chilloutmix_colab/blob/main/stable_diffusion_1_5_webui.ipynb) | [Prompts Collection](/prompts.md)

It does not come with any Loras, you need to type in **CivitAI** to download it yourself, remember to check Save add Additional Network option. ChilloutMix Checkpoint is used by default. Optionally, SunshineMix Checkpoint is used

Currently, Paperspace platform is supported, but Colab is still recommended, because currently, the free Paperspace M4000 GPU does not support Xformers, which will produce pictures slower than Colab.
